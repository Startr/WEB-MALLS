Introduction
-------------

Let us Examine the differences between moths and butterflies.Â Â 

Both moths and butterflies are lovely, but people often prefer butterflies over moths. Because of this confusion, I want to shine a little light on moths. My interest in months started when I was just looking online. And I found an adorable picture of a moth. Even though we later discovered it was a fake image, we still found many real images of cute moths. Let's explore what makes a moth a moth and not a butterfly.

1 they are Cute
---------------

Moths are cute because they have fluffy fur and beautiful patterns. This chubbiness and fluffiness make me and many people think they are cute. What makes you find something cute? There is an interesting overlap between what most people find cute: large eyes and fluffy fur. And the appearance of moths. This is further enhanced when people take them as pets. Over time, people breed the cutest moths to get more chubby and fluffy. Over generations, moths changed till they looked nothing like their wild ancestors.

### - Moths have fur!Â¡!Â¡

Moths have fur, which is a structural type of hair. This fur serves the purpose of helping with protection and heat regulation. Their fur is very fluffy, with little bits of flesh dividing it. Unlike dogs and cats, they only have patches of fur, but their fur is long enough to hide the parts that don't have fur. But  if it stretches, you can see their skin.

### - Fluffy antennas!Â¡!Â¡

Moths' antennae are feather-shaped And fluffy. The shape of their antennae gives them more surface area. The antennae of insects are insects' noses. Moths smell through their fluffy antennae. Thus, the bigger the antennae are, the more fluffy they are, the more they can smell things.

Moths need to be able to smell because most moths can't actually eat but only need to breed and find a mate as soon as they become a moth. Female moths release chemical compounds that sayÂ  I'm looking for a mateÂ¨. Then, when a male picks up on the scent, he will find it irresistible. The male moth will fly towards the female, leading to more caterpillars and then more moths.Â 

### - beautiful patterns!Â¡!Â¡

Months are usually depicted as being black, gray, brown and white, but they can be so many more colours. They can also have beautiful shapes, Such as the death's head Hawk moth. ![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/hQjN1gtH6tmeGL_OLqlJHHq71ry5gVjHztobmi7ewBWweV4FD9wVc7mm_o2V2pYQIVoJpvsFwg2rKflWHxHjnXYGNZ893ao6wq2tD0HaoW_wiUgbuOyusWK6MaNyjgN8Gj42X5uheeXn-mmdfwnpII8)

And if you're going for more  gentle colours, then the rosy Maple moth would suit you.

Â 2 they are Functional
----------------------

### - silk-creators

Silk moths are harvested when they spin their cocoon to make silk in silk Farms. The silk moths that live in silk farms start their lives as caterpillars, also known as silkworms. Then they eat and eat and eat till they're full. Then, they create their cocoon made out of one unbroken strand of silk.Â 

Silk farmers collect and, boil, steam and dry the cocoons, killing the silk moths. Some lucky few get to survive to breed and create more silk moths. But most are killed because if the silk moths hatch from the Cocoon, they will break the valuable thread.

The thread can be used to make wonderful, strong clothes. Silk compared to its weight and size, is five times stronger than steel. Silk has many uses. Silk is not just used for making beautiful clothes; doctors also use it. Doctors use it for replacing tendons in your body that you damaged.

### - spread pollen

Some moths, like butterflies, eat nectar, which means that they spread pollen from flower to flower. Spreading pollen is essential because if flowers don't get pollen from other flowers, they can't make more flowers. Every plant that has fruit has a flower, so if there were no flowers, there would be no fruits.Â 

If there were no moths or other pollinators, there would be no fruit-bearing plants. If there were no fruits, there would be no apples or cucumbers, no tomatoes to make ketchup or pizza, there no fruits of any kind for any creature to eat. Therefore, there would be no fruits for anyone, meaning many animals would starve, and we would starve.

### - In times of scarcity, they are an easily farmed high-protein food source.Â  :(

In times of famine, there are usually lots of moths, which act as a handy food source for most creatures, such as bats, snakes and birds. Even humans farm moths for food when needed. If moths died out, quite a few other species would likely die out from not having moths as a readily available food source.

Â 3 Interesting factsÂ 
---------------------

1.  make cocoons
    ------------

Months make cocoons, while butterflies do not. Butterflies create chrysalises, which are not cocoons but are actually just their skin! Moths also create chrysalises. They create a cocoon around it - a cocoon is made out of silk, which the Moth caterpillar creates.

Moths, while they're caterpillars, need to get the right compounds for their silk. One type of moth eats clothes to get the compounds. This moth is called the clothes moth, but the months don't actually eat wool. It is more often that they eat nectar. If they eat anything at all they're babies, though, Certainly can. Certain species of moths have babies that eat wool because the wool has the exact chemicals it needs to grow up.

1.  Butter moth
    -----------

All butterflies evolved from ancient moths in North America 100 million years ago.

1.  Back to the moon
    ----------------

Moths are attracted to light because they think light is the moon. Their back must also stay to the moon to do directions. So when there is another light, they start to circle around it. They circle around it because they have to put their back towards it. And they repeat and repeat and repeat.

Conclusion
----------

So, to wrap it all up, moths are very cute because they're fluffy, and they have fluffy antennae. They are also cute because they have beautiful fur patterns. They're functional because they spread pollen. They create silk, and in times of scarcity, they are a good food source. I hope that after reading this, you will want to learn more about moths. I also hope that you learn more about butterflies so that you can see that months aren't bad butterflies. They're as good or even better, so think of some questions and try to research them yourself.
