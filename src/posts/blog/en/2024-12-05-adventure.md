summary: >-
  These chapters are the start of my free-writing exploration . I'm
  experimenting with a character waking up in a strange world, navigating a
  fantastical landscape . The story's a collection of observations, thoughts,
  and feelings as I try to figure out who this character is and where they're
  going .


  These chapters are just the beginning, a rough mapping of where I want to go with this story 🗺️.

# Chapter 1

 I wake up, I'm in a grassy clearing of a forest. The grass is tall and wavy ,the trees have Black bark and leaves which are blue . The trees  were quite lush And they had Vines dangling from them ( which are also blue) . It's quite a pretty scene except for the fact that I don't know where I am. I get up  and look around. I hear things in the forest. I see a pathway, probably non artificial. I start walking on it. a bit of time goes by. It starts getting dark ,” I should probably find shelter” I say to myself . A bit of time goes by and I find a red tree similar to the blue trees in that it has black bark but it's more similar to a mangrove tree while the blue are more like oak trees. I gather some of the longest pieces of grass which are several times my length and tie them around the roots of the tree. I get a couple rocks and put them where the entrance is. I go inside and pile the Rocks up to block the entrance. I wonder how I got here, I wonder where here is.

# Chapter 2

 I wake up and take the rocks off of the entrance.I continue my journey on the path .I see something run by the path, similar to how a bunny would run across a path. I get startled by it, but then I go near to investigate I see a small creature similar in body shape to a rabbit. Its Fur is black like the bark of the trees, it has three eyes one on either side of its head and one on The top the eyes are blue in color similar to the leaves of  the trees. I see it and it sees me, nothing happens for a second and then it runs off. I continue walking along the path. After a bit I start getting hungry. I don't have any food on me so I look around for something that looks edible. I find plant that I haven't seen before. It looks like all the other green grass but it has a ball at the top. I pulled down the long  plant. I pull off the bulb. It is a bright lime green. I open it and it has an even brighter green on the inside, that seems to almost be glowing. I put my tongue on it to see if it tastes poisonous. I remember my dad said that poisonous things  taste bitter. It tastes pretty sweet but a little  sour .It reminds me of a lime, but it tastes more like lemonade. I eat it and wait a little bit. I don't feel Sick so I grab more  and eat them. I grab a couple for on the road. 

# Chapter 3

As I walked I noticed the environment was changing and I guess that I was moving into a new biome. This one was more Swampy. The trees were sort of like weeping willows and the bark was brown (finally)! I kept on walking till the past did not exist, it was just so muddy. the grass was few and far between and short (still tall compared to regular grass).  Also there appear to be creatures similar to frogs but much bigger… They were around the size of cats.  I tried to stay far from them and they seem to try to stay far from me. They were interested in colors though lots of bright and Pinks oranges and cyans. They only had two eyes. After a bit of marching through the swamp I exited into a large Plains. again there wasn't any clear path so I just kept on walking straight.The grass here is much shorter. It's around the size of slightly tall regular grass.I keep on walking till I come across a lake. I can see fish swimming in it but it interesting thing about the fish is that their mouths appear to be cross-shaped. which means they have four jaws which are all 90° from each other.

# Chapter 4

 I keep on walking around the lake Till I see something in the distance, something I haven't seen before. It looks… Like a village! I keep on walking, not sure to turn back or to speed up. Eventually I'm close enough to the Village to see the people inside of it. They're not humans , They look more like ferrets . I'm not quite sure what to do and then one of them starts turning towards me. I jump towards a bush and hide in it. The “Person” looks at the bush I jumped in and probably just guesses that animal jumped into it and they shrugs it off and  continue talking with the other person . I can't understand what they're saying that makes sense since I'm a human and they're … something else. The ones that it was talking to points towards the Bush that I'm at and starts walking towards it . All I can feel is panic. They keep on walking. I'm frozen in place. I don't know what to do. They come to the bush, open it up, look inside…  and they see me! They start talking and then realize they were being silly. They took out something from their pocket and ate it. When they talked again I could understand them. “ Hey, are you a new Wizard?”  They say . I stare at them with shock, not really moving nor knowing what to say. He turned to the other person and sayd” dude there's a new Wizard in here”.
