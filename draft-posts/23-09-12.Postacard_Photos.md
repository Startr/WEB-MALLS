Pico

I chose this picture because it was a beautiful shot of Pico with nice blue clouds and an orange sunrise. Mount Pico is the mountain that you see in the photo. It is 2 km high and would technically be the world's second-largest mountain, except for this partially submerged in the water, so it doesn't count. The colors of sunrise are caused by the rays of light from the sun going through the water in the air and refracting into those colors. Technically this is like a rainbow.

Walk To The Beach

I took this picture because I wanted to celebrate the first day of being back in the Azores and exploring it again. The sky in this photo is not actually white - it is a very nice blue. Because it is so bright the camera could not take it.

Lush Walk

I took this picture because I found the green lushness beautiful. This is the pathway that leads from our house down to the main road. There is also another pathway to the main road, but this one is more pretty.

Horta City Night Sky

I took this shot because I wanted to have a photo of the city of Horta while it was nighttime. I find that this photo has a lot of green, yellow and orange. These colors do not come from plants but from the lights.

Moony Morning 

I saw the beautiful purples, grays and light blues in the sky, so I took a photo. I called this one Moony Morning because it has the colors of when I think of the moon, except for when the moon is a golden yellow.

The Light Of Day

I took this photo because when I looked outside I saw a beautiful sunrise. That morning was very bright. Most mornings, like in my shot called Pico, are usually less bright. This particular morning was very bright so I called it The Light Of Day.
