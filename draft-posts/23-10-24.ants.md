Intro
-----

What are ants? Ants are small insects that live in colonies. They do not have hives like bees but they do make structures in the ground and sometimes in the air. The ones in the ground are large tunnel systems with rooms inside of the tunnels. The ones in the air are technically not in the air but in the trees. They bend leaves into rooms and use vines instead of tunnels. In an ant colony there is one queen ant which is the mother to all the other ants in the colony.

What I learned
==============

I find ants very interesting, so I started researching  more about them. I learned about ants - many types of ants. I learned not just about the many species and how they are built, but also what they do. For example:

Mega colony ants
----------------

Mega colonies are when a group of ants create a colony and then new queens from that colony create new colonies. Then those colonies,  instead of going to war, they all see each other as the same and this is what a mega colony is.

Slaver ants
-----------

Slaver ants don't exactly take other ants as slaves. Instead, they do kidnapping and forced adoption - which isn't really that much better. Some slaver ants have evolved so much to do slavery that they can't even take care of themselves. All they can do is take slaves that will take care of them. 

Conclusion 
==========

To summarize, ants are a species of insect that form colonies with one queen, and a bunch of workers and warriors. In the bibliography  you will see the videos that I used to learn for creating this - and this is\
-the ant-.

My 3 takeaways were:

### 1\. Sim ants

My first big takeaway from this video was that people have stimulations of ants to move around and show which is the best way to get to a  position. People have them for driving, some people have them for looking at what is the best way to go through  outer space. People use these simulations of ants for movement most of the time.

### 2\. They farm?!

Leaf cutter ants don't actually eat leaves as the name suggests. Instead what they do with the leaves is they chop them into smaller and smaller pieces. Then they give these pieces to fungi to have  fungus grow on to the pieces. Then they eat the fungi. In a way that means they are farming.

---
### 3\. Bad for the farm

Leaf cutter ants aren't good for farmers because leaf cutter ants destroy the leaves of  plants which hinders the plants from growing. Even though leaf cutter ants do farming themselves, when leaf cutter ants do their own farming they actually compost the leaves, which in turn helps the plants. This causes more plants to grow, which can in turn, cause more diverse life to come to wherever the ants are.
